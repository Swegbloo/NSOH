"Holy Grail" of courses focusing on potential flow based numerical tatics relevant for naval architects and ocean engineers.
Essentially teaches us how to build a potential flow solver on our own by practical coding based assignments.\\
Topics: Strip Theory, Linear 3D Panel Method, Rankine Panel Method, Time Domain Panel Method (IRF) along with code.
